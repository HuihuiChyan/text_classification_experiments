# text_classification_tf_estimator
Text classification using tf.estimator API. The model is very simple with just one-layer Bi-LSTM. And since the training data is also very small, can only get 0.75 accuracy on dev data.  
Just for testing the tf.estimator API, which is easy to use(maybe even not easy) but hard to debug.
