a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy .
. . . a preachy parable stylized with a touch of john woo bullet ballet .
the result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a halloween that died .
forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining .
it's dumb , but more importantly , it's just not scary .
by the end of it all i sort of loved the people onscreen , even though i could not stand them . perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter . it's not an easy one to review .
why make a documentary about these marginal historical figures ? wouldn't one about their famous dad , author of death in venice , etc . , be more valuable ?
let's face it -- there aren't many reasons anyone would want to see crossroads if they're not big fans of teen pop kitten britney spears .
another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through .

contains the humor , characterization , poignancy , and intelligence of a bad sitcom .
sheridan . . . smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth .
soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , xxx achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence .
this film's relationship to actual tension is the same as what christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation .
schnitzler's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying .
this thing is just garbage .

yet another arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents .
take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we've seen and all you have left are john leguizamo's cool jackets .
filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life .
ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies . enigma lacks it .
a reworking of die hard and cliffhanger but it's nowhere near as exciting as either .
every nanosecond of the the new guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable . something like scrubbing the toilet . or emptying rat traps . or doing last year's taxes with your ex-wife .
slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ?
for a film about explosions and death and spies , " ballistic : ecks vs . sever " seems as safe as a children's film . well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies .
starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clich√©s .
seagal , who looks more like danny aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie .
feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot .

mariah carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in glitter here in wisegirls .
might be one of those vanity projects in which a renowned filmmaker attempts to show off his talent by surrounding himself with untalented people .
strictly a 'guy's film' in the worst sense of the expression .
oversexed , at times overwrought comedy/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single .

how inept is serving sara ? it makes even elizabeth hurley seem graceless and ugly .
a story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material .
scorsese doesn't give us a character worth giving a damn about .
the director's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that's low on both suspense and payoff .
while there's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo's dumbed-down tactics ) , much ado about something is an amicable endeavor .
there are moments of real pleasure to be found in sara sugarman's whimsical comedy very annie-mary but not enough to sustain the film .

the leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting .
don michael paul uses quick-cuts , ( very ) large shadows and wide-angle shots taken from a distance to hide the liberal use of a body double ( for seagal ) .
this is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be .
a mimetic approximation of better films like contempt and 8 1/2 .
if i spy were funny ( enough ) or exciting ( enough ) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it's trying to reap from the moviegoing public .
there ain't a lot more painful than an unfunny movie that thinks it's hilarious .
benigni presents himself as the boy puppet pinocchio , complete with receding hairline , weathered countenance and american breckin meyer's ridiculously inappropriate valley boy voice .

a technical triumph and an extraordinary bore .

no amount of nostalgia for carvey's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey's considerable talents are wasted in it .

might best be enjoyed as a daytime soaper .
watching " ending " is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor's garage sale . you can't believe anyone would really buy this stuff .
aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash . stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by dustin hoffman that is revelatory .

feels less like it's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers .
an improvement on the feeble examples of big-screen poke-mania that have preceded it .
this one is a few bits funnier than malle's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks .
none of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest .
rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the na√Øf's encounter with the world .
the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap . any rock pile will do for a set . reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap .

for most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence .
occasionally interesting but essentially unpersuasive , a footnote to a still evolving story .
while certain cues , like the happy music , suggest that this movie is supposed to warm our hearts , jeong-hyang lee's film is just as likely to blacken that organ with cold vengefulness .
it's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good .
an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film .

all of the filmmakers' calculations can't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness .
the screenplay sabotages the movie's strengths at almost every juncture . all the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable .

an unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas .

an uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening .
while [hill] has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film .
the film's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style .
a profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility .

russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of sommers's title-bout features .

a very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel .
how i killed my father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you're watching an iceberg melt -- only it never melts .
takes one character we don't like and another we don't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and isn't very funny .
this is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea ( or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really ) in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question 'why ? '
there aren't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of georgian jews in tel aviv .

mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor .
the angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging .
the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendly‚Ä¶ alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown .
it tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world .
too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , frank novak's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless .
does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny .
the movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun .
my advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack .
imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you've imagined the ring .

the first mistake , i suspect , is casting shatner as a legendary professor and kunis as a brilliant college student--where's pauly shore as the rocket scientist ?
haneke's script ( from elfriede jelinek's novel ) is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending .
instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , hart's war , like the st . louis rams in the super bowl , waits until after halftime to get started .
the mantra behind the project seems to have been 'it's just a kids' flick . ' translation : 'we don't need to try very hard . '
adam sandler's heart may be in the right place , but he needs to pull his head out of his butt
a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless .

will probably stay in the shadow of its two older , more accessible qatsi siblings .
equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid .
apparently writer-director attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film .
the problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay .

this miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing flatbush machismo will get it through .
to work , love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer . that is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion .

each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense .
the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written . . . in the thrall of a vicious hangover .
banal and predictable .
although based on a real-life person , john , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours .
[crystal and de niro] manage to squeeze out some good laughs but not enough to make this silly con job sing .
little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point . . . is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable .
there's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of joan's prefeminist plight , so we're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity .

in the new guy , even the bull gets recycled .

i'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment . there's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease .
no matter how firmly director john stainton has his tongue in his cheek , the fact remains that a wacky concept does not a movie make .

sadly , 'garth' hasn't progressed as nicely as 'wayne . '
what is 100% missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting .
it won't harm anyone , but neither can i think of a very good reason to rush right out and see it . after all , it'll probably be in video stores by christmas , and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies .

villeneuve spends too much time wallowing in bibi's generic angst ( there are a lot of shots of her gazing out windows ) .

impostor is a step down for director gary fleder .
the movie spends more time with schneider than with newcomer mcadams , even though her performance is more interesting ( and funnier ) than his .

the best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast .
a surprisingly flat retread , hobbled by half-baked setups and sluggish pacing .
a beautifully shot but dull and ankle-deep 'epic . '
smothered by its own solemnity .

the sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once .
none of these characters resembles anyone you've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter .
it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like my big fat greek wedding

always destined to be measured against anthony asquith's acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation .
this overlong infomercial , due out on video before month's end , is tepid and tedious .
without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace .
a few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot hasn't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun .
feels like one of those contrived , only-in -hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating oscar talk .
the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie's rude and crude humor .
further sad evidence that tom tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning run lola run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap .
the movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates .
sit through this one , and you won't need a magic watch to stop time ; your dvd player will do it for you .
an exhausting family drama about a porcelain empire and just as hard a flick as its subject matter .

it's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much norma rae and not enough pretty woman .
the movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction .
it was a dark and stormy night . . .
perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that isn't this painfully forced , false and fabricated .
yes , i have given this movie a rating of zero . but fans of the show should not consider this a diss . consider it 'perfection . '
time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool " clockstoppers , " but that doesn't mean it still won't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life .

it could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director clare peploe's misunderstanding of marivaux's rhythms , and mira sorvino's limitations as a classical actress .
i liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it's too long and it goes nowhere .
neither revelatory nor truly edgy--merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored .
entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel .

nothing in waking up in reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay .
technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial .
earnest but earthbound . . . a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast .
frenetic but not really funny .
a handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on pbs than a night out at an amc .

too much of the humor falls flat .
adam sandler is to gary cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse .
a bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort .
like an afterschool special with costumes by gianni versace , mad love looks better than it feels .
a fast-paced , glitzy but extremely silly piece .
so much about the film is loopy and ludicrous . . . that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened .
characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .
the problematic characters and overly convenient plot twists foul up shum's good intentions .
perhaps the most annoying thing about who is cletis tout ? is that it's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime .
not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at .
the director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom .
is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film ? i don't think so . nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me .
wishy-washy .
there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust .

this 10th film in the series looks and feels tired .
ritchie may not have a novel thought in his head , but he knows how to pose madonna .
the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it's actually pretty good in the first few minutes .
has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together tv episodes .
it sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that's more or less how it plays out .
just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making ararat far more demanding than it needs to be .

do not , under any circumstances , consider taking a child younger than middle school age to this wallow in crude humor .
parents beware ; this is downright movie penance .
a sha-na-na sketch punctuated with graphic violence .
an extraordinarily silly thriller .
it's unfortunate that wallace , who wrote gibson's braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue .
the film didn't convince me that calvin jr . 's barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of chicago's south side .
horrid little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the serbs themselves but also to a network of american right-wing extremists .
the movie's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension .

the kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion .
a low-budget affair , tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction . then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed .
it is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by southern blacks as distilled through a caucasian perspective .
returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy .
return to neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run-of-the-mill disney sequel intended for the home video market .
the story's pathetic and the gags are puerile .
the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .
wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time .

what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian .
the film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing .
incoherence reigns .
there are touching moments in etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject .
cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth .

at the very least , if you don't know anything about derrida when you walk into the theater , you won't know much more when you leave .
woefully pretentious .
well , jason's gone to manhattan and hell , i guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels ( hey , don't shoot the messenger ) .
little more than a frothy vanity project .
leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances .
might have been better off as a documentary , with less of mr . eyre's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage .
in this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian .
both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded .
the work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who can't get out of his own way .
so devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like xxx and collateral damage seem like thoughtful treatises
whenever you think you've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end . but , no , we get another scene , and then another . you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain .
fincher takes no apparent joy in making movies , and he gives none to the audience .

press the delete key .
a dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness .
the film is surprisingly well-directed by brett ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act .
it doesn't help that the director and cinematographer stephen kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel .
instead of contriving a climactic hero's death for the beloved-major- character-who-shall- remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens' laser guns actually hit something for once ?
nicks , seemingly uncertain what's going to make people laugh , runs the gamut from stale parody to raunchy sex gags to formula romantic comedy .

presents nothing special and , until the final act , nothing overtly disagreeable .
the movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark .
an uneven look into a grim future that doesn't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on philip k . dick stories .
no , it's not nearly as good as any of its influences .

the misery of these people becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle , to be consumed and forgotten .
it's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish .
silly stuff , all mixed up together like a term paper from a kid who can't quite distinguish one sci-fi work from another .
adolescents will be adequately served by the movie's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a 'topless tutorial service . '
sorority boys , which is as bad at it is cruel , takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it .
while solondz tries and tries hard , storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket .

the umpteenth summer skinny dip in jerry bruckheimer's putrid pond of retread action twaddle .
the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run .
yet another weepy southern bore-athon .
mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer's bloated effects fest the mummy returns .
unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook .
the twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows .

the movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as jules verne's '20 , 000 leagues under the sea' and the george pal version of h . g . wells' 'the time machine . ' but its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .

crummy
such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us " the skulls " and last year's " rollerball . " enough said , except : film overboard !

a relative letdown .
egoyan's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious .

intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area .
this is a movie that starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable .
the film's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency . it's just filler .
these two are generating about as much chemistry as an iraqi factory poised to receive a un inspector .
writhing under dialogue like 'you're from two different worlds' and 'tonight the maid is a lie and this , this is who you are , ' this schlock-filled fairy tale hits new depths of unoriginality and predictability .

by-the-numbers yarn .
the only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its labor day weekend upload , feardotcom should log a minimal number of hits .
harry potter and the chamber of secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate . it's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you'll likely think of this one .

lyne's latest , the erotic thriller unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded .
had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin .
a fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming .
spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations
with zoe clarke-williams's lackluster thriller " new best friend " , who needs enemies ? just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills .

after the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clich√©s , depression and bad alternative music .
this dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old hollywood saw : evil is interesting and good is boring .

even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation cannot engage .
the sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset .
. . . irritating soul-searching garbage .
[t]oo many of these gross out scenes . . .
solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke
while it is interesting to witness the conflict from the palestinian side , longley's film lacks balance . . . and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context .

tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often .
creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller .

woody allen has really found his groove these days . the problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another .
this romantic/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in .
off the hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director adam watstein with finishing it at all .
a minor-league soccer remake of the longest yard .
too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes .
[janey] forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies .

it's not just the vampires that are damned in queen of the damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate .
yes , spirited away is a triumph of imagination , but it's also a failure of storytelling .
sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ain't- she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff .
it's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel .
the most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 miles to graceland .
the problem is not that it's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes . the problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material .

it's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff .
